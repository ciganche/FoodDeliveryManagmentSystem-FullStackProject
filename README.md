A website servis for ordering meals, delivering and managing assests I submitted as my web programming course's project. 

There are 3 types of users:
1. Customer - a person who lists restaurants, meals and creates orders ( account example - username: **tjoki** password: **12345**) 
2. Courier - a worker who delivers orders to customers ( account example - username: **dostavimti** password: **12345**)
3. Admin - a person who manages all assets in the system. An admin can add, remove or modify restaurants, meals, coustomers and couriers. ( account example - username: **admin** password: **admin**)

Due to the strict project specification all entities are saved in .csv files.
